# deque - A (mostly) lock-free concurrent work-stealing deque

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kinghajj/deque.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kinghajj/deque)

This module contains an implementation of the Chase-Lev work stealing deque
described in ["Dynamic Circular Work-Stealing Deque"](https://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/work-stealing-dequeue.pdf). The implementation is
heavily based on the implementation using C11 atomics in "Correct and
Efficient Work Stealing for Weak Memory Models".

The only potentially lock-synchronized portion of this deque is the
occasional call to the memory allocator when growing the deque. Otherwise
all operations are lock-free.

## Example

```Rust
use deque;

let (worker, stealer) = deque::new();

// Only the worker may push/pop
worker.push(1);
worker.pop();

// Stealers take data from the other end of the deque
worker.push(1);
stealer.steal();

// Stealers can be cloned to have many stealers stealing in parallel
worker.push(1);
let stealer2 = stealer.clone();
stealer2.steal();
```

## History

The `deque` module was originally authored by Alex Crichton on 2013-11-26,
commit a70f9d7324a91058d31c1301c4351932880d57e8 in the Rust git repo.

It was later removed by him as part of the `sync` module rewrite on 2014-11-24
in commit 71d4e77db8ad4b6d821da7e5d5300134ac95974e.

With the introduction of the crates.io package repository, I decided to bring
back the module as its own crate. The code is based on the version in the Rust
repo just prior to the aforementioned commit for the `sync` module rewrite. All
changes so far are only ones required to get the code and tests to compile.
